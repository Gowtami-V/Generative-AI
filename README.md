# GENERATIVE AI

## Introduction

Generative AI represents a groundbreaking advancement in artificial intelligence, characterized by its ability to create new and original content. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily analyzes and processes existing data, generative AI models are designed to produce new data that mimics the patterns and structures found in their training sets. This technology leverages sophisticated algorithms and neural network architectures, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers, to generate text, images, audio, and even video.
